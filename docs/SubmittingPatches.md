# Patch submission

Development on MCUboot takes place in the [MCUboot GitHub
repository](https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot).

Changes must be submitted via GitHub pull requests. Each commit should
have a "Signed-off-by" line mentioning the author (and the committer, if
that is different). It is not necessary (or possible) to get a
"Signed-off-by" from Github itself, even though some commits may be
generated by that tool.

The Signed-off-by line should be at the end of the commit text, in the
last blank-line-separated section. There can be multiple lines in this
section, as the format is similar to RFC-2822. Currently, the supported
trailer lines are structured as follows:

- A line that indicates that the signer agrees to the "Developer
Certificate of Origin" located at the bottom of this page:

  ```
      Signed-off-by: Developer Name <devname@example.com>
  ```

- A line that links this commit to specific GitHub issues, if present:

  ```
  Keyword #GH_issue_number
  ```

  For more details about linking a GitHub pull request to a GitHub issue,
  see this [link]
