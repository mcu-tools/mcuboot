	  If y, the swap upgrade is done in two steps, where first every

	  If y, instead of saving the encrypted image keys in plaintext in the

	  when there is no security mechanism protecting the data in the primary
	  slot from being dumped. If n is selected (default), the keys are written
	  after being decrypted from the image TLVs and could be read by an
