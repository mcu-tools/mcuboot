/** The cbor_decode library provides functions for decoding CBOR data elements.
 *
 * This library is primarily meant to be called from code generated by
 * $CDDL_GEN_BASE/scripts/cddl_gen.py
 *
 * Some details to notice about this library:
 *  - Integers are all 32 bits (uint32_t). This means that CBOR's 64 bit values
 *    are not supported, even when the code is running on a 64 bit architecture.
 *    This applies to integer types, as well as lengths for other types.
 *  - Strings are kept in the container type cbor_string_type_t, which is a
 *    pointer and a length.
 *  - When a function returns false, it only means that decoding that particular
 *    value failed. If a value is allowed to take multiple different values,
 *    another decoding function can be called if the first fails.
 *  - There is some type casting going on under the hood to make the code
 *    generator friendly. See especially the processor_t type which is compatible
 *    with all functions except multi_decode, but the compiler doesn't "know"
 *    this because they are defined with different pointer types. It also means
 *    any usage of multi_decode must be made with care for function types.
 *
 *
 * CBOR's format is described well on Wikipedia
 *  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR
 * but here's a synopsis:
 *
 * Encoded CBOR data elements look like this.
 *
 * | Header             | Value                  | Payload                   |
 * | 1 byte             | 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes | 0 - 2^64-1 bytes/elements |
 * | 3 bits | 5 bits    |
 * | Major  | Additional|
 * | Type   | info      |
 *
 * The available major types can be seen in @ref cbor_major_type_t.
 *
 * For all types, Values 0-23 are encoded directly in the "Additional info",
 * meaning that the "Value" field is 0 bytes long. If "Additional info" is 24,
 * 25, 26, or 27, the "Value" field is 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes long, respectively.
 *
 * Major types PINT, NINT, TAG, and PRIM elements have no payload, only Value.
 * PINT: Interpret the Value as a positive integer.
 * NINT: Interpret the Value as a positive integer, then multiply by -1 and
 *       subtract 1.
 * TAG: The Value says something about the next non-tag element.
 *      See https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml
 * PRIM: Different Values mean different things:
 *       20: "false"
 *       21: "true"
 *       22: "null"
 *       23: "undefined"
 *       >=0x10000: Interpret as IEEE 754 float with given precision
 *
 * For BSTR, TSTR, LIST, and MAP, the Value describes the length of the payload.
 * For BSTR and TSTR, the length is in bytes, for LIST, the length is in number
 * of elements, and for MAP, the length is in number of key/value element pairs.
 *
 * For LIST and MAP, sub elements are regular CBOR elements with their own
 * Header, Value and Payload. LISTs and MAPs can be recursively encoded.
 *
 * The additional info means slightly different things for different major
 * types.
