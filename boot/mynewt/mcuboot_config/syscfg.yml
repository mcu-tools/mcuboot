    BOOTUTIL_DOWNGRADE_PREVENTION:
        description: >
            Select downgrade prevention strategy.
            - none downgrades are allowed
            - version:
                Prevent downgrades by enforcing incrementing version numbers.
                When this option is set, any upgrade must have greater major version
                or greater minor version with equal major version. This mechanism
                only protects against some attacks against version downgrades (for
                example, a JTAG could be used to write an older version).
            - security_counter:
                security counter is used for version eligibility check instead of pure
                version.  When this option is set, any upgrade must have greater or
                equal security counter value.
                Because of the acceptance of equal values it allows for software
                downgrades to some extent.
        choices:
            - none
            - version

        value: none

            Because of the acceptance of equal values it allows for software

            Store the boot state/measurements in shared memory.
            If enabled, the bootloader will store certain boot measurements such as
            the hash of the firmware image in a shared memory area. This data can
            be used later by runtime services (e.g. by a device attestation service).
