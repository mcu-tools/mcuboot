mcuboot 0.9 - Release Notes
===========================

Welcome to the first release of MCUBoot, a secure bootloader for 32-bit MCUs.
It is designed to be operating system-agnostic and works over any transport -
wired or wireless. It is also hardware independent, and relies  on hardware
porting layers from the operating system it works with. For the first release,
we are pleased to announce support for three open source operating systems -
Apache Mynewt, Zephyr Project, and RIOT.
